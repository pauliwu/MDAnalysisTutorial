MDAnalysis Tutorial
===================

:MDAnalysis version: â‰¥ |MDAnalysis_version|
:Tutorial release: |release|
:Last updated: |today|


MDAnalysis_ is an open source Python library that helps you to quickly
write your own analysis algorithm for studying trajectories produced
by the most popular simulation packages [Gowers2016]_
[Michaud-Agrawal2011]_.

This tutorial serves as an **introduction to MDAnalysis**. It starts
out with *installing the library* and then introduces the key components
of the library. It will show you 

* how to load a structure or a MD trajectory; 
* how to select parts of your system;
* how to work with atoms, residues and molecules through the object-oriented
  interface of MDAnalysis;
* how to analyze MD trajectories;
* how to write out modified trajectories;
* how to use algorithms in the  `MDAnalysis.analysis`_ module
  (intermediate level of difficulty)

The tutorial contains many links to the `online documentation`_ ,
which you can use to learn more about the functions, classes, an
methods that are discussed. The online help together with the
interactive Python documentation (``help(...)`` or ``...?`` in
:program:`ipython`) should help you while you are using the library.

If you have **questions or suggestions** please post them in the
`MDAnalysis User Discussion Group`_.
